The NIHR-funded HIC project is concerned with the creation of research
datasets in five key clinical domains: Acute Coronary Syndromes,

Each is to populated with data taken from routine clinical care, and
integrated across five of the largest teaching hospitals in the United

\end{itemize}

Key ideas:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Data Elements can be used across different DataModels - favourites or shopping cart.
	\item Unique Identification of DataElements 
	\item Documentation can be automatically generated for review purposes
	\item Consistency checking carried out on data elements
	\item Generation of XSDs, XML, and Forms as output, interfacing with OpenClinica.
	\item Data Provenance
\end{itemize}
