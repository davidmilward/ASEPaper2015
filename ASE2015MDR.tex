\begin{abstract}
  Scientific progress in medicine is increasingly dependent upon the
  large-scale integration of data from a range of sources.  This data
  is acquired in different contexts, held in different systems, and
  subject to different processes and constraints.  The value of the
  integrated data relies upon common data points having a consistent
  interpretation in each case; to achieve this at scale requires
  appropriate informatics support.  This paper explains how a
  model-driven approach to software engineering and data management,
  in which software artefacts are generated automatically from data
  models, can be used to achieve this.  It introduces a simple data
  modelling language, consistent with standard object modelling
  notations, together with a set of tools for model creation,
  maintenance, and deployment.  It reports upon the application of
  this approach in the provision of informatics support for two
  large-scale clinical research initiatives.
