  Scientific progress in medicine is increasingly dependent upon the
  large-scale integration of data from a range of sources.  This data
  is acquired in different contexts, held in different systems, and
  subject to different processes and constraints.  The value of the
  integrated data relies upon common data points having a consistent
  interpretation in each case; to achieve this at scale requires
  appropriate informatics support.  This paper explains how a
  model-driven approach to software engineering and data management,
  in which software artefacts are generated automatically from data
  models, can be used to achieve this.  It introduces a simple data
  modelling language, consistent with standard object modelling
  notations, together with a set of tools for model creation,
  maintenance, and deployment.  It reports upon the application of
  this approach in the provision of informatics support for two
  large-scale clinical informatics initiatives.
=======
Lack of common agreement on data standards across the healthcare industry have resulted in a proliferation of standards and schema which are used for implementing the data schemas and forms used both in patient care and clinical trials. In order to manage data interoperability in two separate projects in the UK NHS we have used a combination of model-driven techniques combined with the principles identified in ISO11179 standard for metadata registries to build a “Model Catalogue” toolkit, which is a model-driven toolkit designed to enhance the quality, provenance and interoperability of data. This paper introduces the thinking behind the “Model Catalogue” and describes the positive results we have had with the toolkit in two separate healthcare projects, in particular an improvement in data interoperability from the use of automated forms generation and overall in data quality between different hospital trusts.

  % Various aspects of the management of the data---specification,
  % collection, integration, presentation, application, and feedback to
  % specification again---are amenable to automation if we have a
  % description of the data that our tools can work with.  Sure, we want
  % metadata, but we want descriptive metadata.  We want data models.  

  % This paper reports upon the development and application of
  % supporting tools for automation of some of these aspects, assisting
  % domain experts and software engineers in achieving the kind of
  % large-scale data integration needed for effective translational
  % research.  It begins with an explanation of the modelling framework
  % required.  It describes the design and functionality of the tools,
  % based around the 'model catalogue'.  It reports upon the experience
  % of applying the tools in providing national support for large-scale
  % clinical research.  It sets out some lessons learned.
