\begin{abstract}
Lack of common agreement on data standards across the healthcare industry have resulted in a proliferation of standards and schema which are used for implementing the data schemas and forms used both in patient care and clinical trials. In order to manage data interoperability in two separate projects in the UK NHS we have used a combination of model-driven techniques combined with the principles identified in ISO11179 standard for metadata registries to build a “Model Catalogue” toolkit, which is a model-driven toolkit designed to enhance the quality, provenance and interoperability of data. This paper introduces the thinking behind the “Model Catalogue” and describes the positive results we have had with the toolkit in two separate healthcare projects, in particular an improvement in data interoperability from the use of automated forms generation and overall in data quality between different hospital trusts.
