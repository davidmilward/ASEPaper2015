\begin{abstract}
  Large-scale data integration: combining data from heterogeneous
  sources and providing users with a unified view.  More than that in
  practice: it's not a single unified view, but one for each different
  class of user, and for each of the usages that they have in mind.
  Relies upon achieving semantic interoperability: in terms of the
  data---it would be good to have some data that is actually
  compatible---but also in terms of the metadata---if your data isn't
  compatible with mine, fine, that's just the way it is, but I need to
  know.  We are talking big data.  But our definition of big data is:
  need more automation that we have, because it's too big to do this
  manually, with the tools that we are using at present.  

  Various aspects of the management of the data---specification,
  collection, integration, presentation, application, and feedback to
  specification again---are amenable to automation if we have a
  description of the data that our tools can work with.  Sure, we want
  metadata, but we want descriptive metadata.  We want data models.  

  This paper reports upon the development and application of
  supporting tools for automation of some of these aspects, assisting
  domain experts and software engineers in achieving the kind of
  large-scale data integration needed for effective translational
  research.  It begins with an explanation of the modelling framework
  required.  It describes the design and functionality of the tools,
  based around the 'model catalogue'.  It reports upon the experience
  of applying the tools in providing national support for large-scale
  clinical research.  It sets out some lessons learned.
