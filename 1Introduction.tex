\section{Intoduction}

The UK NIHR Health Informatics Collaberative is backing a cross-Trust Programme across 5 key NHS Hospital trusts in the UK in order to set up a flexible and responsive governance framework, whereby research outcomes can rapidly be exploited by the NHS community. The work is currently limited to 5 clinical areas, but is expected in time to be extended. One of the aims of the programme is to develop tools and services for research, so that researchers can clinicians can have access to a wider cross Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) dataset. The programme has been working on developing a federated metadata registry, based on ISO11179\cite{ISO11179}, for use as a basis for enabling interoperability primarily for research data from clinical trials but also with a view to integrating this capabiliy with Electronic Patient Records (EPR) data within the trusts.
